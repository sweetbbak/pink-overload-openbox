## Pink Overload

# basic controls

meta+left, meta+right - snap window left and right 50% x 100%
meta+up & down - center window (two sizes)
meta+shift+up - fullscreen/maximized
meta+f - true fullscreen
meta+ctrl left/right/up/down (moves windows by a small increment and moves them across monitors)
meta 1-9 change workspaces
meta+d is bound to rofi
meta+q closes windows
meta+w opens firefox
meta+e opens thunar
meta+x bound to skippy-xd

I recommend reading the rc.xml file and editing everything and making sure it works for you.
